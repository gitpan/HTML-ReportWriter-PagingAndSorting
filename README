HTML/ReportWriter/PagingAndSorting version 1.0
===============================================

This module provides a simple OO interface to paging and sorting logic
necessary to easily implement page-able, sortable reports in HTML.

It expects that the user is using MySQL as a datasource. The example
included in the synopsis also expects the user to be using the Template
Toolkit. Both of these expectations however could be done away with,
although I have at this time no reason to contemplate the exact uses for
this module without those two "dependencies".

If you're interested in a more complete solution for HTML reporting on
DB-driven data, check out the parent module, HTML::ReportWriter.
